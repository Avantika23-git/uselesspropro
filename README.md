Project Name: Exam Detector – AI That Judges Your Exam Face


Team Members:

Team Lead: Avantika

🧠 Project Description
Exam Detector is a real-time, browser-based AI that scans your face before exams and accurately detects your current mental state: “Mugging Mode”, “Last Minute Panic”, or “Full Surrender”. It uses face detection and expression classification to throw truth bombs at you. No more pretending you’re fine.

🚫 The Problem (That Doesn’t Exist)
Sometimes you don’t know if you’re done preparing or just done with life. Friends lie. Mirrors lie. But your face doesn’t.

💡 The Solution (That Nobody Asked For)
We built an AI web app that opens your webcam and reads your facial expressions to categorize your current exam survival mode. Bonus: it roasts you too. Because why not?
